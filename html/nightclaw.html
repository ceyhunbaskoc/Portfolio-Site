<h2>🛠️ Building Construction Logic</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Our main character arrives at an object that can be turned into a building (stone, mound of earth, bush, etc.) and fills the money slots.</strong></li>
<li><strong>The building enters the construction process and the nearest builders rush to the construction site.</strong></li>
<li><strong>The more builders there are in a construction site, the faster the construction will be finished.</strong></li>
<li><strong>When the building is completed, a sum of money is deducted according to the value of the building and the builder receives this money.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Builder gives it to us when he is next to our character.</strong></li>
</ul>
